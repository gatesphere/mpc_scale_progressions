# mpc_scale_progressions.py

A simple script to create .progression files for use in MPC to allow
non-standard scales to be played in Pad Perform.

Usage is in the header of the script.

Once the .progression files are imported properly into MPC, use the 
"Progression" function of the Pad Perform settings, choose the Scale
progression you wish to play, and play as if you were in Notes mode.
Each pad corresponds to a single note in the scale, just like in Notes
mode.
